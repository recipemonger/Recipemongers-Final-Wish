# Single-Serving Hot Cocoa

## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar (depending on how sweet you like it)
* Pinch of salt
* 1 cup milk or any combination of milk, half-and-half, or cream.
* ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Notes
* 1 tablespoon sugar seems like the perfect balance.
* Milk is overrated, use oat milk.

## Instructions
1. Whisk together the cocoa, sugar, salt, and about 2 tablespoons milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until cocoa and sugar are dissolved. Whisk in the rest of the milk and heat it over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until it is hot. Stir in the vanilla and serve.

2. If you like it frothy, blend it in the blender.

3. This recipe multiplies easily. When you get up to a quart of milk, use ¼ teaspoon salt.
